/**
 * FPS Control has two primary areas, this plugin class just keeps those areas up to date and handles setup / teardown.
 *
 * <p>Overlay paints the current FPS, the color depends on whether or not FPS is being enforced.
 * The overlay is lightweight and is merely and indicator.
 *
 * <p>Draw Listener, sleeps a calculated amount after each canvas paint operation.
 * This is the heart of the plugin, the amount of sleep taken is regularly adjusted to account varying
 * game and system load, it usually finds the sweet spot in about two seconds.
