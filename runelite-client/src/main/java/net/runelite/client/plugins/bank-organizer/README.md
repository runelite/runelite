# Bank organizer & Clean-up
Simple pre-set categories that can be toggled individually and customized for exclusions and color-coding.
some categories may be paired together - as per user preference (e.g. not seperate farming/potions/tools/food, .. etc.)

Special clean-up at bottom for quest and otherwise obsolete items wasting space in the bank.

(*Note that there are certain niche-items required by diary steps or specific clue steps (bullroarer/ice gloves for example) that will not be marked, while others - such as HAM robes are marked to discard, but are clue required. Make decisions accordingly.)
